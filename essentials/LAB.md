# Component Architecture Salmon Cookies

Recreate the salmon cookies lab from scratch using the VanillaJS Component Architecture we used in class.

Feel free to reuse html and small JavaScript algorithms - but build the app incrementally. This means, 
don't try and copy/edit to get to work. Build up.

* Do the Planning Stage
    * Visual Decomposition
    * Component Tree with state owners and props passing (including event callbacks)
* `index.html`, images, css and other resources can stay the same
* use new `html.js`
* Follow the Project Organization (`components` folder in `js`)
* Don't forget `.eslintrc`, `.travis.yml`, etc!
