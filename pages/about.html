                <p>
                    The start of Salmon Industries came at the turn of the 20th century, during the great salmon shortage that shocked the Northwest and lead eventually to the Great Depression (not many people know this fact of history).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Philanthropist founder John Ebel Inglestock saw it as his duty to protect the pocketbooks of the rich aristocrats in Washington D.C. The Depression had hit investments hard. The top 1% needed a place where they could stash their money safely and expect reliable returns. Inglestock made sure that the requirements for buying stock in his company precluded any of those who weren't born with a silver spoon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    John's youngest son, Teddy Lederhosen Inglestock, was a different breed. He came of age during age of Free Love, and upon the death of his extremely elderly father, Teddy decided to open his company up for the masses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, in the 21st century, Salmon Industries specializes in making salmon cakes, just like Teddy's mom once made, and they sell them to the masses. They also produce and sell crude oil, whale blubber, depleted uranium, and state secrets to anyone who will listen.
