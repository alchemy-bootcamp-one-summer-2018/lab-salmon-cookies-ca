Pat has asked you to come up with all other aspects of the design for both documents, including a color scheme and a custom font, and maybe additional images, for a public-facing webpage.

So, in addition to building an application that calculates daily sales projections for each location (in a file called sales.html), you also need to create a pubic-facing page (in a file called index.html) that is colorful, eye-catching, readable, useful, informative... and ultimately of a quality ready for use on T-shirts, stickers, coffee mugs, cookie bags, napkins, and so on.

### Public-Facing Page (index.html)

Besides using the picture of the fish... you should use...

1. A custom font for highlights
2. A specified standard san-serif web font for data (such as Arial, Verdana, or Helvetica)
3. A specified standard serif web font for text (such as Georgia, Times, etc.)
4. Specified different font colors for all three font usages
5. A background color for the default page background (make sure font colors have good contrast and are readable on this background)
6. A different background color for elements such boxes and tables (so make sure the font colors contrast against this well, too!)
7. Anything else you'd like to add related to style. But remember: simplicity, clarity,  and consistency are good things in design.
8. Be thoughtful about layout and overall organization of the page.
9. Include all of the typical stuff that you'll find on the home page of a business: locations, hours, contact information, some text about how awesome the business is, etc. Be creative, and again, think about what is meaningful to a typical end user.

### Calculate Daily Sales Projections (sales.html)

Get started on your _static design_ of the sales page. It is much easier to code a dynamic, interactive app if you know the target html and css.

See the example image, though yours should match your homepage design.

Here are some store locations you can use in your static design:
      
* 1st and Pike
* SeaTac Airport
* Seattle Center
* Capitol Hill
* Alki
