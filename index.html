        <p>Let's have a happy little tree in here. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Imagination is the key to painting.</p>
        <p>I get carried away with this brush cleaning. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. It's cold, but it's beautiful.</p>
        <p>Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You gotta think like a tree. Now then, let's play.</p>
        <p>Have fun with it. Do an almighty painting with us. Put it in, leave it alone. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart.</p>
        <p>Now it's beginning to make a little sense. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Use your imagination, let it go.</p>
        <p>Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Get tough with it, get strong. There are no limits in this world.</p>
        <p>All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. This is the fun part It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Learn when to stop. Maybe there's a little something happening right here.</p>
